# Random Color Generator

This is a simple web page that changes the background color when the button is clicked. The colors are generated randomly and displayed on the button itself. The heading on the top is of different color so that at certain point same colors do not covers the heading entirely.

## Purpose

I developed this project during my JavaScript learning phase to practice and enhance my skills. It was a fun exercise in understanding event handling, DOM manipulation, and styling with JavaScript. I have make use of the Math Object in JavaScript and generated a random numbers which are passed on to the function so that the color can be generated.
